  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan Selection">
    Select the plan that you want to subscribe to

  </Step>
  <Step title="Property Management Type">
    Select whether you intend to use Rent3 for short to medium-term property management or long-term.

<Tip>
  It's important that you select this correctly. Rent3 is designed to support both property management types; however, functionality changes depending on your option. Currently, it is not possible to switch types after signing up.

### Billing Setup

Once your account is created, you will be redirected to Stripe to set up your subscription. This can be cancelled at any point through Billing Settings.

After your Stripe subscription is set up, you will be able to access your dashboard straight away and begin adding your Properties.
